Its a full GPT4All installation, not only chat, lot of tips exist in /usr/local/bin/GPT4All speciall for python guys...
You are free to maintain it in the SBo way and simply remove my name, no copyrights

Deps are in slack-required file

If you upgrade from older version to new after package build finish just do the old time classic 
# upgradepkg /tmp/gpt4all-2.6.1-x86_64-1_rtz.txz

This way your old models and localldocs will stay in place ;)
